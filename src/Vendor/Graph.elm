{-| This module contains the primitives to build, update and traverse graphs.
If you find that this module is hard to use or the documentation
is insufficient, consider opening an issue for that (and possibly even a
pull request :)).

Internally, we use the `elm-intdict` package for efficient dynamic graph
representation.

One can build such a graph with the primitives under _Build_. Most of the time

{-| Analogous to `Dict.update`, `update nodeId updater graph` will find
the node context of the node with id `nodeId` in `graph`. It will then call `updater`
with `Just` that node context if that node was found and `Nothing`
otherwise. `updater` can then return `Just` an updated node context
(modifying edges is also permitted!) or delete the node by returning
`Nothing`. The updated `graph` is returned.

This is the most powerful building function since all possible per-node
operations are possible (node removal, insertion and updating of context
properties).

The other operations can be implemented in terms of `update` like this:

    remove nodeId graph =
        update nodeId (always Nothing) graph

    insert nodeContext graph =
        update nodeContext.node.id (always (Just nodeContext)) graph

{-| `symmetricClosure edgeMerger graph` is the

a corresponding reverse edge. This implies that `ctx.incoming` == `ctx.outgoing`
for each node context `ctx`.

`edgeMerger` resolves conflicts for when there are already edges in both
directions, e.g. the graph isn't truly directed. It is guaranteed that
`edgeMerger` will only be called with the smaller node id passed in first
to enforce consitency of merging decisions.
