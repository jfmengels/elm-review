# Support Channels

You can find the docs for the Elm package [here](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/), and the ones for the CLI [here](https://github.com/jfmengels/node-elm-review/).

The `#elm-review` channel on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.slack.com/) is the fastest way to get help using or creating rules.

If you want to propose rule ideas, or find other people's ideas, create a discussion in the [rule ideas](https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/discussions/categories/rule-ideas) category.

I hope this helps!
