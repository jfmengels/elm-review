in C-style syntax are `NotNestable`, meaning they can be implemented like this:

In fact, `multiComment "/*" "*/" NotNestable` *is* implemented like that! It is
very simple, but it does not allow you to nest comments like this:

```javascript

line3

```

It would stop on the first `*/`, eventually throwing a syntax error on the
second `*/`. This can be pretty annoying in long files.

Languages like Elm allow you to nest multi-line comments, but your parser needs
to be a bit fancier to handle this. After you start a comment, you have to
detect if there is another one inside it! And then you have to make sure all
the `{-` and `-}` match up properly! Saying `multiComment "{-" "-}" Nestable`
does all that for you.

array of UTF-16 characters. `getOffset` tells you your index in that flat
array. So if you chomp `"\\n\\n\\n\\n"` you are on row 5, column 1, and offset 4.

**Note:** JavaScript uses a somewhat odd version of UTF-16 strings, so a single
character may take two slots. So in JavaScript, `'abc'.length === 3` but
`'ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š'.length === 6`. Try it out! And since Elm runs in JavaScript, the offset
moves by those rules.
", name = "getOffset", tipe = Type "Parser.Parser" [ Type "Basics.Int" [] ] }, { comment = " Code editors treat code like a grid, with rows and columns. The start is
`row=1` and `col=1`. As you chomp characters, the `col` increments. When you
run into a `\\n` character, the `row` increments and `col` goes back to `1`.

In the Elm compiler, I track the start and end position of every expression
like this:

    type alias Located a =
      { start : (Int, Int)
      , value : a
      , end : (Int, Int)

    located : Parser a -> Parser (Located a)
    located parser =
      succeed Located
        |= getPosition
        |= parser

So if there is a problem during type inference, I use this saved position
information to underline the exact problem!

**Note:** Tabs count as one character, so if you are parsing something like
Python, I recommend sorting that out *after* parsing. So if I wanted the `^^^^`
underline like in Elm, I would find the `row` in the source code and do
something like this:

    makeUnderline : String -> Int -> Int -> String
    makeUnderline row minCol maxCol =
      String.toList row
        |> List.indexedMap (toUnderlineChar minCol maxCol)
        |> String.fromList

    toUnderlineChar : Int -> Int -> Int -> Char -> Char
    toUnderlineChar minCol maxCol col char =
      if minCol <= col && col <= maxCol then
        '^'
      else if char == '\\t' then
        '\\t'
      else
        ' '

So it would preserve any tabs from the source line. There are tons of other
ways to do this though. The point is just that you handle the tabs after
parsing but before anyone looks at the numbers in a context where tabs may
equal 2, 4, or 8.

    boolean =

**Note:** The fact that `spaces` comes last in the definition of `elm` is very
important! It can succeed without consuming any characters, so if it were the
first option, it would always succeed and bypass the others! (Same is true of
`chompWhile` in `js`.) This possibility of success without consumption is also
why wee need the `ifProgress` helper. It detects if there is no more whitespace
to consume.

for Elm would need to handle integers, floats, and hexadecimal like this:

    type Expr
      = Variable String
      | Int Int
      | Float Float
      | Apply Expr Expr

    elmNumber : Parser Expr
    elmNumber =

        , binary = Nothing  -- 0b1101 is not

If you wanted to implement the [`float`](#float) parser, it would be like this:

    float : Parser Float
    float =
      number
        { int = Just toFloat
        , hex = Nothing
        , octal = Nothing

Notice that it actually is processing `int` results! This is because `123`
looks like an integer to me, but maybe it looks like a float to you. If you had
`int = Nothing`, floats would need a decimal like `1.0` in every case. If you
like explicitness, that may actually be preferable!

**Note:** This function does not check for weird trailing characters in the
current implementation, so parsing `123abc` can succeed up to `123` and then
move on. This is helpful for people who want to parse things like `40px` or
`3m`, but it requires a bit of extra code to rule out trailing characters in
other cases.

characters. Once a path is chosen, it does not come back and try the others.

**Note:** If you need something more custom, do not be afraid to check

to hack high-level parsers to do things they are not made for.

should not be used for binary operators like `+` and `-` because you can find
yourself in weird situations. For example, is `3--4` a typo? Or is it `3 - -4`?

A potential pitfall when parsing keywords is getting tricked by variables that
start with a keyword, like `let` in `letters` or `import` in `important`. This
is especially likely if you have a whitespace parser that can consume zero
charcters. So the [`keyword`](#keyword) parser is defined with `token` and a
trick to peek ahead a bit:

    keyword : String -> Parser ()
    keyword kwd =
      succeed identity
        |. backtrackable (token kwd)
        |= oneOf
            [ map (\\_ -> True) (backtrackable (chompIf isVarChar))
            , succeed False
            ]
        |> andThen (checkEnding kwd)

    checkEnding : String -> Bool -> Parser ()
    checkEnding kwd isBadEnding =
      if isBadEnding then
        problem ("expecting the `" ++ kwd ++ "` keyword")
      else
        commit ()

    isVarChar : Char -> Bool
    isVarChar char =
      Char.isAlphaNum char || char == '_'

This definition is specially designed so that (1) if you really see `let` you
commit to that path and (2) if you see `letters` instead you can backtrack and
try other options. If I had just put a `backtrackable` around the whole thing
you would not get (1) anymore.
